# Micromouse Simulation System
This is a grid world simulation of the micromouse maze solving robot

## Algorithm ðŸ§ª
- The Flood-Fill algorithm is used to perform the search run and discover the maze. This algorithm initializes the maze structure in memory and identifies the shortest possible path by traversing the maze
- Maze Generator code uses a textual representation of the maze and generates the maze.
